#############################################################
// try fetch with axios: refactor the fetch with apiCall module

// toggle functionality between tagged and posts
// on Click style of p change style ref :https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63154498/change-component-property-through-onclick

###################

// next : interchange color navbar/ body

// next :gradient of main photo, read and inspire from code of senzig

// next : tagged functionality:

- optimize name of state photos
- the names of the small rounded images shouldn't be random on mounting

##############
try to build with useFetch and react-form-hook

next : "tagged" functionality has to work

- inside header-cards should run random Name only on load, not when component is mounting
- header cards fixed names
- make the link component togglebuttonpost reusable, pass down the prop value "POSTS" etc.

- learn NavLink,react router dom

- instead of Link , Navigation comp, inside Link Comp , when the its clicked then update a state

- next: @ Navbar , style login signup btns
